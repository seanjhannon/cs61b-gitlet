# cs61b-gitlet

The final project for UC Berkeley's Computer Science Class CS61B - Data Structures.
Project consists of implementing a version-control system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular system Git.
My implementation includes the commands: `init`, `add`, `commit`, `rm`, `log`, `global-log`, `find`, `status`, `checkout`, `branch`, `rm-branch`, `reset`, and `merge`.

Full spec available here:
